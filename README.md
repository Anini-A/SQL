# ðŸŽ¯ SQL Challenge

I will share my SQL hands on practice here. 

Please feel free to download and use all code as your own.

Website: https://www.sql-practice.com/ to practice at your own pace.

Note that the website offers the option to export your work into a JSON file. Just in case you clear your browsing data, you can always import your work and continue where your left off. 

Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
