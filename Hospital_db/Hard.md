### Difficulty level: Hard ðŸ”´

#### Question 1
Show all of the patients grouped into weight groups.
Show the total amount of patients in each weight group.
Order the list by the weight group decending.

For example, if they weight 100 to 109 they are placed in the 100 weight group, 110-119 = 110 weight group, etc.
   ```
select
  count (patient_id) as patient_in_group,
  floor (weight / 10) * 10 as weight_group
from patients
group by weight_group
order by weight_group desc;
  ```

#### Question 2
Show patient_id, weight, height, isObese from the patients table.
Display isObese as a boolean 0 or 1.
Obese is defined as weight(kg)/(height(m)2) >= 30.
weight is in units kg.
height is in units cm.
   ```
select
  patient_id,
  weight,
  height,
  CASE
    WHEN weight / POWER((height / 100.0), 2) >= 30 THEN 1
    ELSE 0
  END isObese
from patients
  ```
  
#### Question 3
Show patient_id, first_name, last_name, and attending doctor's specialty.
Show only the patients who has a diagnosis as 'Epilepsy' and the doctor's first name is 'Lisa'

Check patients, admissions, and doctors tables for required information.
   ```
SELECT
  p.patient_id,
  p.first_name,
  p.last_name,
  d.specialty
FROM patients p
  JOIN admissions a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
  JOIN doctors d ON a.attending_doctor_id = d.doctor_id
WHERE
  a.diagnosis = 'Epilepsy'
  AND d.first_name = 'Lisa';
  ```
  
#### Question 4
All patients who have gone through admissions, can see their medical documents on our site. Those patients are given a temporary password after their first admission. Show the patient_id and temp_password.

The password must be the following, in order:
1 patient_id
2 the numerical length of patient's last_name
3 year of patient's birth_date
   ```
SELECT
  patient_id,
  CONCAT(
    patient_id,
    LENGTH(last_name),
    YEAR(birth_date)
  ) AS temp_password
FROM patients
WHERE patient_id IN (
    SELECT patient_id
    FROM admissions
  );
  ```
   
#### Question 5
Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. All patients with an even patient_id have insurance.

Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance. Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance group.
   
   ```
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 'Yes'
    ELSE 'No'
  END AS has_insurance,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 10
      ELSE 50
    END
  ) AS admission_total
FROM admissions
GROUP BY has_insurance;
  ```
  
#### Question 6
Show the provinces that has more patients identified as 'M' than 'F'. Must only show full province_name

   ```
SELECT province_name
FROM patients
  JOIN province_names ON patients.province_id = province_names.province_id
GROUP BY province_name
HAVING
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN gender = 'M' THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) > SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN gender = 'F' THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  );
  ```

#### Question 7
We are looking for a specific patient. Pull all columns for the patient who matches the following criteria:
1 First_name contains an 'r' after the first two letters.
2 Identifies their gender as 'F'
3 Born in February, May, or December
4 Their weight would be between 60kg and 80kg
5 Their patient_id is an odd number
6 They are from the city 'Kingston'
   ```
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE
  first_name LIKE '__r%'
  AND gender = 'F'
  AND MONTH(birth_date) IN (2, 5, 12)
  AND weight BETWEEN 60 AND 80
  AND patient_id % 2 = 1
  AND city = 'Kingston';
  ```

#### Question 8
Show the percent of patients that have 'M' as their gender. Round the answer to the nearest hundreth number and in percent form.
   ```
SELECT
  round(100 * avg(gender = 'M'), 2) || '%' AS percent_of_male_patients
FROM patients;
  ```
   
#### Question 9
For each day display the total amount of admissions on that day. Display the amount changed from the previous date.
   ```
SELECT
  admission_date,
  COUNT(*) AS admissions_count,
  COUNT(*) - LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY admission_date) AS change
FROM admissions
GROUP BY admission_date;
  ```
   
#### Question 10
Sort the province names in ascending order in such a way that the province 'Ontario' is always on top.
   ```
SELECT province_name
FROM province_names
ORDER BY
  CASE
    WHEN province_name = 'Ontario' THEN 0
    ELSE 1
  END,
  province_name ASC;
  ```
